# Queries for adding database rows for newly added sounds

Use these queries starting at version 5.0.0 when updating to any version beyond 5.0.0 -- if updating through multiple versions, use each update's section. (e.g. updating from 5.0.0 to 5.3.0 would have you use the queries from 5.1.x, 5.2.x and 5.3.0)

**If below version 5.0.0, use the [database migration script](https://github.com/robflop/megumin.love/blob/master/dbUpdate_v5.js) first.**

The [sqlite3 CLI tool](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) is recommended to be used alongside these queries.

### Version 5.1.0
